# fitness-reminder

Simple java application to set up visual reminders to do fitness exercises

When working at the computer we often forget to do fitness or simple exercises. This application shows a popup containing a user-selected image with a text in regular intervals, so that we don't forget to make a small break and do some exercises.

**Why not just using one of the plenty mobile apps?**

Push notifications can get pretty annoying. Besides, I've noticed that I tend to ignore the phone vibrations. Thus, I came to the conclusion that a visual reminder that is shown directly on the screen where you working at, is much more reliable can't be ignored that easily.

**System requirements**

Java runtime environment with at least version 1.8

**Local data storage**

The app configuration is stored as a JSON file in the user's home directory.
